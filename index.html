        	<h2>Welcome to The Asclepy Platform. We are still working on creating this amazing hub where you will find everything you
			need to live a truly comfort live.  </h2>

       	  <h3>Mission</h3>
        	<p>Asclepy has been created to stand by peopleâ€™s health and grooming necessities that arise with the latest tendencies. Health is a number one priority and should never be neglected. Therefore, Asclepy helps people stay on top of their health matters by providing an efficient, convenient and trustworthy healthcare service that is always focused on the customer experience. In fact, our main goal is to seek for an optimum and personalized experience for our consumers. This encourages us to offer other lines of services that will enable the maximization of our client's well-being. Our main objective as a healthcare company is to create an atmosphere of privacy and comfort between every worker and every client. Hence, our services are eventually fated to help everyone, including those with rare diseases. We need to fight the stigmas of minorities.
Asclepy is based on a new standard of healthcare that can coexist with the traditional centralized system of hospitals. We do not look forward to debunking hospitals. Actually, we are open to negotiating in order to offer together the best possible experience to the patient. 
With regards to work conditions, Asclepy stands by giving the worker freedom in its schedule and paying hourly wages. We can only expect medical excellence from individual initiative. Also, we only work with high quality suppliers, with whom we aim to maintain long and fruitful business relationships. Last but not least, if the presence of Asclepy upsets any group of people or institution, we will always be open to politely hear their complaints.

<h3>More information</h3>
        	<p>I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to do as they wish with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users too much, and for this reason I leave the defining of any content related styles to you.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<h3>Template Notes</h3>
            <p>The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever dimensions you'd like.  If you choose the latter, you must open up style.css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different. If you would like to move the heading around in the above image, find &quot;#mainpic h1&quot; in style.css and modify it's &quot;left&quot; and &quot;top&quot; properties, this is also true for the h2 tag.</p>
