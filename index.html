        	<h2>Welcome to The Asclepy Platform. We are still working on creating this amazing hub where you will find everything you
			need to live a truly comfort live.  </h2>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	  <h3>Mission</h3>
        	<p>Asclepy has been created to stand by people’s health and grooming necessities that arise with the latest tendencies. Health is a number one priority and should never be neglected. Therefore, Asclepy helps people stay on top of their health matters by providing an efficient, convenient and trustworthy healthcare service that is always focused on the customer experience. In fact, our main goal is to seek for an optimum and personalized experience for our consumers. This encourages us to offer other lines of services that will enable the maximization of our client's well-being. Our main objective as a healthcare company is to create an atmosphere of privacy and comfort between every worker and every client. Hence, our services are eventually fated to help everyone, including those with rare diseases. We need to fight the stigmas of minorities.
<br>Asclepy is based on a new standard of healthcare that can coexist with the traditional centralized system of hospitals. We do not look forward to debunking hospitals. Actually, we are open to negotiating in order to offer together the best possible experience to the patient. 
<br>With regards to work conditions, Asclepy stands by giving the worker freedom in its schedule and paying hourly wages. We can only expect medical excellence from individual initiative. Also, we only work with high quality suppliers, with whom we aim to maintain long and fruitful business relationships. Last but not least, if the presence of Asclepy upsets any group of people or institution, we will always be open to politely hear their complaints.

        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
        	<p>After overcoming all the challenges that a start-up might face, Asclepy will be provide the healthcare system that people trust the most. Its civic transparency will never be condemnable and its creation will be considered a major breakthrough in private medicine. Our methods will work so well that the name of the Greek god Asclepius will be familiar even to children, from A Coruña to Zwolle (i.e.: everywhere).</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<h3>Values</h3>
            <p>Despite Asclepy operating in the private sector, we believe that Human Beings have the right to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without suffering financial hardship . Therefore, we don’t aim to profit from people’s basic necessities. We also believe in the necessity of the customer’s information privacy when data is collected for medical purposes and in the importance of Asclepy being a transparent company that its customers can trust. Since Asclepy wants to improve people’s health in any way within its reach, its catalogue of services will never be considered complete, as we are always open to improve people’s lives in new and innovative ways. Our main objective is people’s well-being, and if we believe that a person needs specialized help we will gave them a referral to such help.</p>
